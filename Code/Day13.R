# Task 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Initial idea was to shift all busses by the minutes after bus 1, but the vector
# memory got wrecked and wouldn't go large enough... Worked on the test cases real
# nice though.

# Then tried creating a remainder index for all bus id's and building a sequence of 
# the first bus times, then checking all subsequence busses leave at time + remainder.
# For loops are painfully slow though...

# Next idea was to iteratively build an intersection vector, adding busses one by one.

# Finally solved with a hybrid of idea 1
